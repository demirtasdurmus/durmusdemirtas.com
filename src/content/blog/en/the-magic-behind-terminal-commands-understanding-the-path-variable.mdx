Have you ever wondered how your terminal recognizes commands like `ls`, `cd`, or `python`? The secret lies in an essential environment variable called `PATH`. This article will unravel the significance of the `PATH` variable, explaining how it helps your system locate and execute commands. By the end, you'll also learn how to modify the `PATH` variable to include your own scripts, enhancing your command-line experience.

This tutorial is specifically tailored for Unix-like systems, with a focus on macOS. The principles discussed here apply to other Unix-like systems, such as Linux. If you are using Windows, the concepts are similar, but the implementation differs. For Windows, you can set the PATH variable through the System Properties dialog or using the `setx` command in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of terminal commands
- macOS operating system
- Terminal application

## Understanding the PATH Variable

Let's start with a simple question: What is the `PATH` variable, and why is it important?

The `PATH` variable is an environment variable that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files. When you type a command into the terminal, the shell looks through the directories listed in the `PATH` variable to find the corresponding executable file. If the file is found, the command runs; if not, you'll get an error message, most of the times something like `bash: command not found: <some-invalid-command>`

We can view the `PATH` variable by opening up a terminal and running the following command:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

This command will output a colon-separated list of directories. Here's an example output:

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

Each of these directories contains executable files that you can run from the terminal. For instance, the `ls` command is located in `/bin`, and that's why you can run it from anywhere in the terminal.

## Why Update the PATH Variable?

When you install new software or create your own scripts, you might need to update the `PATH` variable so that the terminal can recognize these new commands. For example, if you install a tool like Python, Node.js or Postgresql using a package manager, it often recommends adding a specific directory to your `PATH`.

Let's say you installed Postgresql@15 via homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. After installation, it will request you to update the `PATH` variable as shown below. Without this update your system will not recognize Postgresql related commands.

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"
```

This command appends `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin` to the existing `PATH` variable. However, this change is temporary and will be reset when you close the terminal. To make the change permanent, you need to add the export command to your shell's configuration file. For macOS, if you are using the default shell (zsh), you can add it to the `.zshrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If you are using bash, you would add it to the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will add the export statement to your configuration file, which will update the `PATH` variable each time a terminal session is opened. So, you will be able to run Postgresql related commands.

## Creating Your Own Scripts

Now that you understand how to update the `PATH` variable, let's create a simple script and add it to a directory included in your `PATH`.

1. Create a new directory for your scripts:

```bash
mkdir ~/myCustomScripts
```

2. Add this directory to your `PATH` and run the `source` command to reload the configuration file in the current session.

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:~/myCustomScripts"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Create a file named `greet` and open it with your preferred code editor, here I will use nano for the sake of simplicity:

```bash
touch ~/myCustomScripts/greet
nano ~/myCustomScripts/greet
```

First add the shebang `#!/bin/bash` at the top of the file, which means that this file should be executed as a bash script. Then, add a simple bash script to greet and give the current date in the specified format:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, today is $(date +%d.%m.%y)"
```

At this point, the terminal will recognize the command. But if you attempt to run it, you will get `permission denied: greet` error. Because, the file is not an executable file yet. Let's do this next.

4. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/myCustomScripts/greet
```

5. Run your script from anywhere in the terminal:

```bash
greet
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Hello, today is 12.07.24
```

Keep in mind that the above command is maybe useless and created for just demonstration purposes. You can create more complex commands to meet your specific needs and usecases.

## Conclusion

The `PATH` variable is a fundamental part of the terminal's functionality, enabling it to locate and execute commands. With a grasp of the PATH variable, you can enhance your command-line operations by adding new tools and custom scripts to your workflow. This skill opens up a world of possibilities for personalizing and optimizing your terminal usage on your system.
